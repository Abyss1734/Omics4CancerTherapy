# Omics4CancerTherapy

This project was completed as a masterâ€™s thesis titled "Development of algorithms for selecting promising targets and selective drugs for anti-cancer therapy based on omics data." Based on the analysis of large-scale medical and biological data, algorithms were developed that demonstrated high efficiency in predicting cancer targets and selecting drugs for these targets using the DepMap, UniProt, ChEMBL, and TTD databases.

This repository contains only the code and final visualizations. The folder with full raw data and intermediate files is available via [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vAeP58OGe4vABr9Ekc356JO16omAeBLB/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=115930597739969036594&rtpof=true&sd=true).
